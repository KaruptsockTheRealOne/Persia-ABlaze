Persia Aflame by Robert Graham for Task Group Warrior.


This presumes that you know how to run a DCS Server, have UNSANATIZED the items in missionscripting.lua
Have Slotblocker installed and working on your server.
Have SRS installed and working, check the slothandler1.lua for where srs is used.

Goes hand in hand with our Persia Aflame map server items and of course SRS Bot.
