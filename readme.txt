Persia Aflame by Robert Graham for Task Group Warrior.


This presumes that you know how to run a DCS Server, have UNSANATIZED the items in missionscripting.lua
Have Slotblocker installed and working on your server.
Have SRS installed and working, check the slothandler1.lua for where srs is used.

Goes hand in hand with our Persia Aflame map server items and of course SRS Bot.


You will need to make a folder in your SAVED GAMES\DCS called pg and one in it called scripts so your saved games should have


saved games\dcs\pg
saved games\dcs\scripts

the content of SRC\pg\scripts should be in that folder. The mission loads them in DYNAMICALLY.


No Support is offered for this I can't.. if you make something better from it please return the favour and hand back the code.

If you make things run smoother please be nice and hand back the code.

etc. etc
